### About

I am an interdisciplinary researcher trained in sociology with a professional background in computer engineering.
The problems I am primarily interested in are at an intersection of sociological theory, philosophy of social sciences and computer science.
I believe that it is productive and illuminating to cross reference prospective solutions in each of the three fields with fundamental questions in others to safeguard against ill-informed arguments and guide to novel ideas.

As an early career researcher, having graduated in 2023 from the University of Manchester with an M.A. in Sociology, I look forward to becoming a part of global academic communication and deciding whether to pursue a PhD or another M.A. in sociology, philosophy or computer science.
Currently based in Belgrade, Serbia.


### Research Interests

scientific reduction, emergence, methodological individualism, social ontology, the epistemology of computer simulations, agent-based modeling, cellular automata
